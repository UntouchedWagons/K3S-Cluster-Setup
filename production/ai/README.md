# Projects in the AI Namespace

At the moment only deepstack lives in this namespace. Deepstack (which is no longer maintained) is used for detecting what objects are in a picture. This is useful for security camera services like iSpyAgentDVR so that recording only happens when a certain thing (like a person) is detected.

I do not use CodeProject AI because I find it far too unreliable to be useful.
