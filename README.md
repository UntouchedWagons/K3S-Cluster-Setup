## K3S-Cluster-Setup

This is my mess of a Kubernetes cluster setup. It is based on Techno Tim's [k3s-ansible playbook](https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible) and his various guides.

## Setup

    git clone https://github.com/UntouchedWagons/K3S-Cluster-Setup
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
